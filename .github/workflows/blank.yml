# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  # 添加定时触发
  schedule:
    # 每天早上8点运行 (UTC时间，对应北京时间16点)
    - cron: '0 8 * * *'

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
